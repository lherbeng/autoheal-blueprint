Can you give me the complete procedure of your recommendation to make this happen. Start from the beginning or where do i need to start 

Certainly! Here's a complete procedure on how to set up Fluent Bit to forward logs from your Kubernetes cluster to AWS CloudWatch Logs. This procedure assumes that you already have a running Kubernetes cluster on AWS and you have AWS CLI and kubectl configured.

1. Create an IAM Role for Fluent Bit:

You need to create an IAM role that Fluent Bit will assume to send logs to CloudWatch Logs. This IAM role should have the CloudWatchLogsFullAccess policy attached, or a custom policy granting permissions to write logs.

1.1. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the IAM service.

1.2. Click on "Roles" and then "Create role."

1.3. Choose "EC2" as the trusted entity type.

1.4. Attach the CloudWatchLogsFullAccess policy or a custom policy with the necessary permissions.

1.5. Review and create the IAM role. Name it something like "FluentBitCloudWatchRole."

2. Configure Fluent Bit:

2.1. Create a Kubernetes ConfigMap to define Fluent Bit's configuration. Create a file named fluent-bit-configmap.yaml:

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: fluent-bit-config
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  fluent-bit.conf: |
    [SERVICE]
        Flush        1
        Log_Level    info
        Daemon       off
        Parsers_File parsers.conf

    [INPUT]
        Name             tail
        Path             /var/log/containers/*.log
        Parser           docker
        Tag              kube.*
        Mem_Buf_Limit    50MB
        Skip_Long_Lines  On
        DB               /var/log/flb_kube.db
        DB.Sync          normal

    [OUTPUT]
        Name          cloudwatch
        Match         kube.*
        region        <AWS_REGION>
        log_group_name <LOG_GROUP_NAME>
        log_stream_name <LOG_STREAM_NAME>

Replace <AWS_REGION>, <LOG_GROUP_NAME>, and <LOG_STREAM_NAME> with your AWS region and desired CloudWatch Logs log group and stream names.

2.2. Apply the ConfigMap to your cluster:

3. Deploy Fluent Bit:

Create a DaemonSet to run Fluent Bit on each node in your Kubernetes cluster. Create a file named fluent-bit-ds.yaml:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: fluent-bit
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fluent-bit
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fluent-bit
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: fluent-bit
      containers:
        - name: fluent-bit
          image: fluent/fluent-bit:1.8
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: 200Mi
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 100Mi
          volumeMounts:
            - name: varlog
              mountPath: /var/log
            - name: varlibdockercontainers
              mountPath: /var/lib/docker/containers
            - name: config
              mountPath: /fluent-bit/etc/
      volumes:
        - name: varlog
          hostPath:
            path: /var/log
        - name: varlibdockercontainers
          hostPath:
            path: /var/lib/docker/containers
        - name: config
          configMap:
            name: fluent-bit-config

3.1. Apply the DaemonSet to your cluster:

4. Associate IAM Role with Nodes:

Attach the IAM role created in step 1 to the worker nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. You can do this by modifying the node IAM role or launching new EC2 instances with the role attached.

5. Verify Logs in CloudWatch:

After Fluent Bit is deployed and running, it will start forwarding logs to CloudWatch Logs. You can verify this by checking your CloudWatch Logs log group in the AWS Management Console.

6. Configure Alerts and Monitoring (Optional):

You can set up CloudWatch Alarms to monitor log streams and receive notifications for specific log patterns or anomalies.

That's it! You've successfully set up Fluent Bit to forward logs from your Kubernetes cluster to AWS CloudWatch Logs. Remember to adjust Fluent Bit configurations according to your specific log collection and forwarding needs, and ensure that your IAM roles and policies are properly configured for security and access control.
